    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk 
      and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter 
        onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular 
        motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, 
        turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
